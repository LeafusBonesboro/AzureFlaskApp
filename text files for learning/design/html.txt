<!-- How It Works Together
View Function:
The server-side view function (in Flask or Django) retrieves a list of profiles from the database or other data source.
This list is passed to the template as the profiles context variable.

Base Template (base.html):
Defines the overall structure and layout of the page, including any common elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
Contains a {% block content %} placeholder where the specific content of each page will be inserted.

Page Template (index.html):
Extends the base template to inherit its structure.
Fills in the {% block content %} with the specific content for the Profiles Index page.
The for loop iterates over the profiles list, generating a list item for each profile and inserting the profile's last name and first name. -->
